{{< admonition type="tip" title="Plots, graphs or charts?" open=false >}}
The words **plot**, **chart** and **graph** are used interchangeably, but I will stick with **chart** in this course. The reason I prefer this term is because it feels more general: for example we could be making a map, and the word "graph" would not make sense. Also, the word "plot" is kind of reserved for some things in Python, and is in use by some graphics libraries.

*As always, beware what you name your files! For example, if you name a file something like `plotly.py`, it will conflict with instructions such as `import plotly`!*

At the end of the last section we had a data app with a layout ready for more components. In this section, we will be bringing data into the app, and creating our first visualisation.

## Bringing our data into the script
We can't get much further in creating a data app without some data! Our input dataset is a CSV of global demographics - information about the economies and populations of countries. We will be using `pandas` to read our data in: Streamlit is built with `pandas` in mind: data workflows and visualisations will usually expect to be working with dataframes.

[Download this `demo_dataset.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milliams/graphical-data-apps/main/demo_dataset.csv) (right-click and *Save link as...*). Put the file into the folder with your `data_app.py` script.

### Loading up `pandas`
First, we need to update our script to import `pandas`. Add this at the top of your script add:

```Python
import pandas as pd
```

Now we can read our dataset into a dataframe using `pandas`. Add this line below your `import`s, but above the rest of your code. We put this near the top is because this code is not related to building the interface: Python will run the script from top to bottom, so it will need to know what your data is before it can do anything with it.

```Python
demo_df = pd.read_csv("demo_dataset.csv")
```

## Exercise 3: Viewing our data
Before we go any further, let's get a feel for what the data is. We can view dataframes in the app itself (and we can even edit dataframes natively in app! but we won't cover this today).

{{< admonition type="question" title="Exercise 3: Populate a tab with a dataframe" open=true >}}
In this exercise, the goal is to use `tab1` to display our dataframe. Remember to save your Python file to see the changes in your Streamlit browser tab.

1. Remove our `st.write()` command from tab 1.
2. Use the command `st.dataframe()` to display our data in tab 1. This command will be expecting the variable containing a dataframe as an argument.

{{< admonition type="warning" title="Exercise 3 solution" open=false >}}
So far, our script should look like this:
```Python 
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# use pandas to read our CSV file into a dataframe called "demo_df"
demo_df = pd.read_csv("demo_dataset.csv")

# build the sidebar
with st.sidebar:
    st.title("World Demographics")

# create two columns, of ratio 3:1
column1, column2 = st.columns([3, 1])

# place info box in first column
with column1:
    st.info("Welcome to the global demographic data explorer app.")

# create two tabs
tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Data", "Visualisation"])

# put some stuff in the tabs to check they are working
with tab1:
    st.dataframe(demo_df)

with tab2:
    st.write("And this is tab two!")
```
{{< /admonition >}}

## Your first chart
Now that we have our data available, we can begin work on visualising it, which will require one more `import`. Add this to your imports at the top of the script:

```Python
import plotly.express as px
```

We are using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for a number of reasons:
- it has an intermediate learning curve
- the [documentation](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/) is good
- the syntax is relatively easy to use, without being over-simplified
- the graphs it creates are good-looking, customisable and interactive.

There are two steps to getting our data from the dataframe to into a graphic:
1. Creating a chart object
2. Asking Streamlit to present this chart object

### Creating a chart
Plotly (and most graphics libraries) work best with dataframes, which we have ready for it. As a minimum, a Plotly scatter chart needs three things: 
1. The datafame to work with
2. The data to plot on the `x` axis (ie, one of the dataframe columns)
3. The data to plot on the `y` axis (another dataframe column)

For points [2] and [3], we need to choose two dataframe columns to plot. Set your dataframe to be displayed (using the checkbox we made earlier). Let's choose the columns `HDI index` as our `x`, and `GDP per capita` as our `y`.
We create our chart object like this:
```Python
chart = px.scatter(
    data_frame=demo_df,
    x="HDI index",
    y="GDP per capita",
)
```
Note that indentation here is for clarity, with each parameter on a new line. If a function is taking lots of parameters, it is good to make things clear with new lines: Python will allow new lines after commas, and convention is to indent to make it clear these are inside brackets. But be aware that this indentation has no functional purpose - it is purely for clarity.

### Displaying the chart
OK, so we have built the `chart` object - now can now display it by handing it to a [chart element](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts), in this case `st.plotly_chart()`. We will put this into our second tab. Add this at the bottom of your script:
```Python
with tab2:
    st.plotly_chart(chart)
```
Save your file, and explore the visual! Investigate what the icons at the top right of your chart do. Double-clicking the chart resets, if you get lost, or click the "rescale" button (it is visible when you mouse over the chart, in the top right).

### Customising our chart
This is a good start, but let's explore more of the parameters that `px.scatter()` can take. Let's colour our dots, using the Continent column of the dataframe as our colouring key. This is done by adding to the arguments building our chart object:
```Python
chart = px.scatter(
    data_frame = demo_df,
    x="HDI index",
    y="GDP per capita",
    color="Continent",
)
```
(Note that the `color` argument is spelled in International English!) Save, and notice the changes.

## Exercise 4: building a better visualisation
{{< admonition type="question" title="Exercise 4: better visuals" open=true >}}
So far, we have a chart which expresses three things: the CO2, GDP and continent of the countries in our dataset. In this exercise, we are adding arguments to `px.scatter()`, to include further data.
1. We can control the size of points. Add a parameter called `size`, and assign the column name `"CO2 per capita"` to it (note that any dataframe column name is a string).
2. Our mouse-hover tooltip is not very useful right now. Add a parameter called `hover_name`, and assign `"Country"` to it.

Your Streamlit script should look similar to this:
```Python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# use pandas to read our CSV file into a dataframe called "demo_df"
demo_df = pd.read_csv("demo_dataset.csv")

# build the sidebar
with st.sidebar:
    st.title("World Demographics")

# create two columns, of ratio 3:1
column1, column2 = st.columns([3, 1])

# place info box in first column
with column1:
    st.info("Welcome to the global demographic data explorer app.")
    
# create two tabs
tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Data", "Visualisation"])

# display the dataframe in tab1
with tab1:
    st.dataframe(demo_df)

# build px chart object
chart = px.scatter(
    data_frame=demo_df,
    x="HDI index",
    y="GDP per capita",
    color="Continent",
    size="CO2 per capita",
    hover_name="Country",
)

# display the chart in tab2
with tab2:
    st.plotly_chart(chart)
```

{{< admonition type="tip" title="Options for plotting libraries" open=false >}}
Streamlit is designed to use [a range of popular Python plotting libraries](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts). These have their strengths and weaknesses. Here is a quick, incomplete summary; click the links for galleries of what each library can do:
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) : a classic Python plotting library. Mature, widely-used, relatively easy, but not as sophisticated as others, and no interactive features.
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html) and [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) : these are both APIs for controlling the mighty [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). Very powerful, but steep learning curve.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) : another JavaScript library, but easier to use than the D3.js wrappers.
- [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) : yet another Python API to control JavaScript!
- [PyDeck](https://deck.gl/showcase) : this runs the Deck.GL graphics library, creating 3D models, from medical to geographical. It also integrates with [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
